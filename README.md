This is a Black Jack Game.

The goal is to get closer to 21 than the dealer without going over.

It is played with a standard set of 52 playing cards.

Aces are worth either 1 or 11 points.

Face cards are worth 10 points.

Dealer and players are dealt 2 cards at the start of the round after a betting phase.

If any player has an ace and either a 10 or a face card as their starting hand, they have a Black Jack and win immediately.

The players only see one of the Dealer's cards.

The player can choose to be dealt another card or stay with what they have.

If they go over 21, they lose.

If the player decides to stay, the Dealer reveals their other card.

If the Dealer has a higher score than the player, the dealer wins.

If the Dealer has a lower score than the player but their score is a 17 with an Ace and 6 or 16 or lower, the dealer has to hit until they either beat the player,
have a score of 17 or higher, or bust.

If the Dealer has a lower score than the player but have a score of 17 or higher, the player wins.
